I use this all the time for project notes, interesting things I want to keep and code snippets.

Added some minor customizations to this version.



![Wikitten Toc Mod](https://raw.github.com/EightMinusEight/Wikitten/master/library/you%20can%20also/nest%20directories/added_toc.jpg)


added tabs to the left nav and auto-gen table of contents for long .html and .md documents

The tabber on the left nav switches between your library folder heirarchy and the currently selected pages contents

Mad props to Wikitten author: [Victor Stanciu](https://github.com/victorstanciu)

Toc plugin thx to:  [jgallen23](https://github.com/jgallen23/toc)
